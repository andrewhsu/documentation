1. Download the `rpk` archive for Linux:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/latest/download/rpk-linux-amd64.zip
```

2. Ensure that you have the folder `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
```

3. Add it to your `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

4. Unzip the `rpk` files to your `~/.local/bin/` directory:

```bash
unzip rpk-linux-amd64.zip -d ~/.local/bin/
```
