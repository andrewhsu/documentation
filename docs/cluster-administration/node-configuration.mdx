title: Node configuration
---

When you bring up the nodes in a redpanda cluster, each node has a `redpanda.yaml` file associated with it. This file is located in `/etc/redpanda`. The `redpanda.yaml` file contains node-level configuration properties with default values already set. A node-level property is one that is always different for each node, such as the `node_id`, or one that can be set differently from node to node.

See Node configuration properties for a list of node-level properties, their descriptions, and their default values.

When you open the default `redpanda.yaml` file, you will see that node-level properties are grouped into these categories:

- `pandaproxy` - properties for the Redpanda HTTP proxy
- `redpanda` - runtime configuration properties, such as the cluster member IP addresses, the node_id, and the data directory
- `rpk` - properties that determine how `rpk` starts redpanda
- `schema registry` - properties related to storage, retrieval, and compatibility of the schemas

To see a sample template that includes all node-level properties as they appear in the default `redpanda.yaml` file, refer to Node configuration template. This template is annotated with descriptions of each property.

## Changing node-level property settings

Although the `redpanda.yaml` file rarely needs to be edited, you can change the value of any node-level configuration property, except for the nodeâ€™s unique node identifier, `node_uuid`. The `node_uuid` value is automatically populated in the `redpanda.yaml` file when the node is brought up and must not be changed.

To change a node-level property setting, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the node where you want to change one or more property settings.

2. Go to the `/etc/redpanda` directory.

3. Open the `redpanda.yaml` file for editing.

4. Change values for properties as needed.

    Once a node joins the cluster, do not change the `node_id`.

5. Save the file and quit the editor.

6. Restart the node to apply the changes.

When redpanda starts up and reads the `redpanda.yaml` file, it checks that each property setting has a valid value. If the file contains an invalid property setting, redpanda will refuse to start and log an error.
