You can run Redpanda directly on Linux. This guide helps you get started with Redpanda for development and testing on Linux.

For production or benchmarking, see [Deploying for Production](../../../deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment).

## Install and run Redpanda

Installation requires just a few commands:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora/RedHat" default>


  ```bash
  ## Run the setup script to download and install the repo
  curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash && \
  ## Use yum to install redpanda
  sudo yum install redpanda -y && \
  ## Start redpanda as a service 
  sudo systemctl start redpanda
  ```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="debian" label="Debian/Ubuntu" default>

```bash
## Run the setup script to download and install the repo
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash && \
## Use apt to install redpanda
sudo apt install redpanda -y && \
## Start redpanda as a service 
sudo systemctl start redpanda
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that Redpanda is up and running: 

`sudo systemctl status redpanda`

The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
redpanda.service - Redpanda, the fastest queue in the West.
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/redpanda.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running)
```

You now have a single-node cluster running Redpanda.

## Start Streaming

`rpk` is a CLI tool you can use to work with your Redpanda nodes. Refer to [rpk Commands](../../../reference/rpk/rpk-topic) for more information about `rpk`.

Here are some sample commands to produce and consume streams:

Create a topic called `twitch_chat`:

```bash
rpk topic create twitch_chat
```

Output:

```text
TOPIC       STATUS
twitch_chat  OK
```

Produce a message into the topic:

```bash
rpk topic produce twitch_chat
```

Enter a message:

```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```

Output:

```text
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629795.
```

Click `ctrl-d` (or `ctrl-z` on Windows) to finish sending messages to the topic.

Consume one message from the topic:

```bash
rpk topic consume twitch_chat --num 1
```

Each message is shown with its metadata, like this:

```json
{
  "topic": "twitch_chat",
  "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
  "timestamp": 1663282629795,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

You can delete your topic by running:

```bash
rpk topic delete twitch_chat
```

Output:

```text
TOPIC       STATUS
twitch_chat  OK
```
