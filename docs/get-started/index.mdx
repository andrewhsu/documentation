- [Introduction to Events and Streaming](../get-started/intro-to-events)
  
  Learn how to develop using Events and Streaming can help you build your product. 

- [How Redpanda Works](../get-started/architecture)

    Redpanda provides strong guarantees to producers that events are stored durably within the system, and consumers can subscribe to Redpanda and read the events asynchronously.

- [Redpanda Licensing](../get-started/licenses)

    Redpanda Community Edition is free and source-available at the Redpanda GitHub repo. Additional features are included with a license for Redpanda Enterprise Edition.

- [Redpanda Quickstart](../get-started/quick-start/quick-start-docker)

    Quickly install and run Redpanda.

- [Introduction to rpk](../get-started/rpk-install)

    Redpanda Keeper (rpk) is a single binary application that provides a way to interact with your Redpanda clusters from the command line. 
    You can install `rpk` as part of a bundle that includes `redpanda` (see the [Install Redpanda](../get-started/quick-start/quick-start-docker) for instructions), or you can install the `rpk` binary separately. 

- [Build a Sample Application](../get-started/code-examples)

    Redpanda is Kafka API-compatible, which means that despite Redpanda being a new streaming data platform, you can leverage the countless client libraries that have been created for Kafka. If you find something that is not supported, reach out to our team in the community Slack.
