title: Consumer Offset
---

## Introduction




When stored in a partition, a sequential number is assigned to each event for order. This number is the _offset_. The offset allows consumer event processing to start or continue from where it left off. So, if you have a consumer application outage that prevents your application from receiving events, you can use the consumer offset to select and send only the events that occurred when the application was down. By default, the offset starts at 0, but you can manually specify a specific start value.

<!-- If a consumer application has an outage preventing it from receiving events, then you can use the consumer offset to select events to send only events streamed by the time the application was out.

## Consumer offset use cases

Following are examples of some typical use cases for consumer offsets in the Redpanda platform.

A primary mechanism for tracking events is a topic, so let’s first create a new topic with 10 partitions:

```bash
rpk topic create orders -p 10
```

Produce some events in the topic “orders”:

```bash
rpk topic produce orders
```

For each event produced, the output will be similar to the following:

```bash
Produced to partition 6 at offset 0 with timestamp 1649269960577.
```

Redpanda automatically assigns the partition, offset, and timestamp. If you want to produce an event for a specific partition, use the `-p` flag followed by the partition number:

```bash
rpk topic produce orders -p <partition_number>
```

Once you are sending events to topics, you can consume them and check to confirm that both partition and offset are assigned. All events sent to a topic will show in the output if no partition is specified:

```bash
rpk topic consume orders -p <partition_number>
```

The output will look similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "value": "order_1",
  "timestamp": 1649269951126,
  "partition": 3,
  "offset": 0
}
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "value": "order_2",
  "timestamp": 1649269960577,
  "partition": 6,
  "offset": 0
}
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "value": "order_4",
  "timestamp": 1649269973940,
  "partition": 8,
  "offset": 0
}
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "value": "order_3",
  "timestamp": 1649269967731,
  "partition": 9,
  "offset": 0
}
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "value": "order_9",
  "timestamp": 1649270168759,
  "partition": 9,
  "offset": 1
}
```

You can view all event tracking structures (topics, partitions, and offsets). All sent events to the `orders` topic are displayed if no partition is specified. For details about `rpk` commands used here, refer to [rpk documentation](/docs/reference/rpk-commands).
