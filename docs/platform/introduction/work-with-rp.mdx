Redpanda offers two main ways to interact with Redpanda clusters and data: using the `rpk` command line interface tool or using the Redpanda Console.

For an introduction to basic `rpk` commands, see [Introduction to rpk](./learn-rpk).

For an introduction to using the Redpanda Console, see [Redpanda Console](./console).
