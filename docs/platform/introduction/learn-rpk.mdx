Redpanda Keeper (`rpk`) is Redpanda's command line interface (CLI) tool. It is designed to manage your entire Redpanda cluster. It handles everything from node configuration to low-level tuning, as well as Apache Kafka-level management tasks like topic creation.

The `rpk` commands feature autocompletion, so that as you type each letter of a command, you can use the tab key to display all commands that start with those letters.
