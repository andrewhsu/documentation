You can run Redpanda directly on Linux. This guide helps you get started with Redpanda for development and testing on Linux.

For production or benchmarking, see [Deploying for Production](../../deployment/production-deployment).

## Install and run Redpanda

Run the following commands to download and install the Redpanda repository, install Redpanda, and start Redpanda as a service.

<InstallRedpandaLinux/>

## Verify that Redpanda is up and running

```bash
sudo systemctl status redpanda
```

The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
redpanda.service - Redpanda, the fastest queue in the West.
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/redpanda.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running)
```

You now have a single-node cluster running Redpanda.
