If you would like to integrate an OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible identity provider that is not yet natively supported in Console,
you can configure the generic OIDC provider. To do so, you first have to create an OAuth application in your identity provider
and then provide this application's credentials in the configuration:

- **Application type:** Web application
- **Authorized redirect URI:** `https://console.yourcompany.com/login/callbacks/oidc`

```yaml
login:
  enabled: true

  # jwtSecret is a random string of at least 10 characters that must be the same for all Console instances. 
  # This string is used to sign and validate the user session JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
  # If this string changes, logged-in Console users will be logged out and will have to initiate a 
  # new session by logging in again.
  jwtSecret: ""

  oidc:
    # Whether or not the OIDC provider should be initialized
    enabled: true

    # OAuth application client id
    clientId: ""

    # OAuth application client secret
    clientSecret: ""

    # IssuerUrl is the identity provider's URL; for example, https://accounts.google.com.
    # Console will send a GET request to `${issuerUrl}/.well-known/openid-configuration` 
    # and the `issuer` returned in the response has to match this issuer url.
    issuerUrl: ""

    # IssuerTLS is the TLS configuration used by the HTTP client to send requests
	  # to the IssuerURL. If you don't set any certificate paths, the IssuerTLS defaults to
    # the system cert pool.
    issuerTls:
      caFilepath:
      certFilepath:
      keyFilepath:

    # DisplayName is the name that shall be shown on the login page for this identity provider
    displayName: ""

    # UserIdentifyingClaimKey is a relevant property if you want to use a specific claim key
    # to identify users in the role binding. A claim key is part of the identity provider's
    # issued access token payload.
    # By default, we will use the 'sub' claim key, which usually resolves to the unique ID 
    # within the identity provider. The value of this claim is compared against what you
    # use in the roleBindings for the `name` property.
    userIdentifyingClaimKey: "sub"
```

:::note
The `userIdentifyingClaimKey` can only be used for claims that have a string value. You cannot use it for the `groups` claim in AzureAD, for example, because the claim value is a string array.

## Define role-bindings

After you set up the OIDC login configuration, you can bind users to roles. Below is a sample
role binding:

```yaml
roleBindings:
  - metadata:
      name: Developers
    subjects:
        # Kind must always be set to `user` for the OIDC provider, as the claims always belong to 
        # an individual user.  This is also true if you match a claim against a group.
      - kind: user
        provider: OIDC
        # Name must match the value of your configured claim key
        name: joe@yourcompany.com
    roleName: editor
```

## Troubleshooting

### Used claim key did not exist in user's id token

If you used a claim key in the role bindings that did not exist in the id token, Console will print
an error message in the backend to assist you with this. The error message contains the claim key 
that Console tried to look up, as well as all existing claim keys for this specific user.

The error message may look similar to this:

> ```
> {
>   "level": "error",
>    "msg": "the specified user identifying claim does not exist for the user that has logged in",
>    "found_claim_keys": ["oid", "aud", "sub"],
>    "used_claim_key": "uid"
> }
> ```

### User claim keys and values are unknown

If you are unsure what claim keys and values would be attached to your id token by your identity provider,
this section guides you how to extract these claims for inspection. Because the claim values may be 
sensitive, these will never be logged in the backend and instead the claims can only be inspected for your
own account in the browser.

When you browse to the Console login landing page it will ask you to authetncate with your configured
OIDC provider. Open your browser's developer tools and head to the place where you can inspect network
requests. Some browsers such as Google Chrome will truncate the network request logs after you've been
redirected. For this troubleshooting guide we want to preserve these logs and thus make sure to enable
the preserve log option.

Now start the login flow, by clicking the OIDC login button and authenticate with your identity provider.
After successful authentication you will see various network requests. Search the list for a request
that starts with the relative path `/auth/callbacks/oidc?code=`. The HTTP response contains a `set-cookie`
header, where we set the `jwt` cookie. The value of that cookie is an encrypted and compressed JSON web token.
Copy the value and initiate a request to the decode endpoint which will print the decoded values:

```
curl -sL -X POST 'https://your-console-url.com/admin/session-token/decode' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "ey..."
}'
```

Replace `ey...` with your copied token. You will receive a JSON formatted response which includes
your `oAuthToken.access_token`. Copy this token, head to https://jwt.io, paste the token value
and you can inspect all decoded claims that can be used in your role bindings.
