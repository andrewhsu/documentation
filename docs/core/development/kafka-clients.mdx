title: Kafka compatibility
---

Redpanda is compatible with Apache Kafka version 0.11 through 3.1.  

## Kafka client compatibility

Clients developed for any version of Kafka typically work with Redpanda. Modern clients auto-negotiate protocol versions or use an earlier protocol version accepted by Redpanda brokers.

The following clients have been validated with Redpanda.

| Language | Client | 
| -------- | ------ | 
| Java | [Apache Kafka Java Client](https://github.com/apache/kafka) | 
| C/C++ | [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) | 
| Go | [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) | 
| Python | [kafka-python](https://pypi.org/project/kafka-python) |
| JS | [KafkaJS](https://kafka.js.org) | 
| Rust | [build.rs](https://github.com/kafka-rust/kafka-rust) | 

:::tip
* Use the latest supported version.
* Other clients, particularly ones based on librdkafka, probably work with Redpanda, but they haven't yet been validated.

## Kafka feature compatibility 

Redpanda supports the following Apache Kafka capabilities:

* Transactions
    * The Transactions API is available in [technical preview](/docs/core/introduction/tech-preview), but it can be enabled by setting both `enable_idempotence` and `enable_transactions` to `true` in the Redpanda config. Supports KIP-345, KIP- 360, KIP-447, and others.
* Static consumer group membership
  *  Supports KIP-345.
* Explicit partition assignment / altering partition assignments (with Kafka API)
    * Supported with the Redpanda Admin API
  
If you run into any issue while working with a Kafka tool, please [file an issue](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/new).

The following administrative Kafka APIs have not yet been directly exposed by Redpanda, but they may be available with the Redpanda Admin API.
