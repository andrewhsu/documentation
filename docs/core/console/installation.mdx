## Local / Quickstart

To connect Redpanda Console to a Kafka cluster running on your local machine
or in another Docker container:

```shell
docker run --network=host \
  -e KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092 \
  docker.redpanda.com/vectorized/console:latest
```

:::note
The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, 
Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server. The recommended approach to test Redpanda Console
on a local machine is to run it with [Docker compose](/docs/core/console/reference/docker-compose) 
so that it can share the network scope with the container that runs the Kafka cluster.
::: 

To connect Redpanda Console to a remote Kafka cluster:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e KAFKA_BROKERS=bootstrap.cluster-hash.redpanda.cloud:9092 \
  -e KAFKA_TLS_ENABLED=true \
  -e KAFKA_SASL_ENABLED=true \
  -e KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM=SCRAM-SHA-256 \
  -e KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME=xxx \
  -e KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD=xxx \
  docker.redpanda.com/vectorized/console:latest
```

:::note
The configuration used in the command above is based on the assumption that you connect to a cluster
that uses commonly trusted certificates as well as SASL plain authentication.

## Docker

Docker images for amd64 and arm64 systems are available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vectorized/console/tags). 
A new Docker image is published for each new (beta) release, as well as for each git push into the repository's main branch.

## Kubernetes

You can use the Redpanda Console Helm chart to deploy Redpanda Console into your Kubernetes cluster. To install
the Helm repository and chart, run:

```
helm repo add redpanda-console 'https://packages.vectorized.io/public/console/helm/charts/' 
helm repo update
helm install redpanda-console/console
```

For a complete list of all chart configuration variables see the chart's 
[values.yaml](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/blob/master/helm/console/values.yaml) file.


If you prefer to create your own manifests instead, you can browse through the Helm chart linked above
or refer to the [configuration](#configuration) section, which describes the configuration requirements
to run Redpanda Console. There is also an example YAML file for the Helm chart in the 
[examples](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/tree/master/helm/examples) directory.

## Binaries and Linux packages

For each new release Redpanda compiles the Redpanda Console to a single binary for macOS, Linux, and Windows
for 64-bit Intel & ARM based chips. You can find the binaries in the attachments of
each release on GitHub.

Additionally, Redpanda pushes Linux packages for Redpanda Console in two different formats: rpm and deb.

To install the Redpanda Console package on **Debian/Ubuntu**, run the following commands:

```
curl -1sLf \
  'https://packages.vectorized.io/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' \
  | sudo -E bash
  
sudo apt-get install redpanda-console
```

To install the Redpanda Console package on **Fedora/RedHat/Amazon Linux**, run the following commands:

```
curl -1sLf \
  'https://packages.vectorized.io/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' \
  | sudo -E bash

sudo yum install redpanda-console
```

## Configuration

You can configure Redpanda Console using environment variables, a YAML file, or a mix of both. To use YAML you
need to set the path to the YAML configuration file by either providing the filepath using the
`-config.filepath` flag or by setting the env variable `CONFIG_FILEPATH`. Due to the complexity
of some configuration objects it is recommended that you use YAML and only provide sensitive values such as
passwords using the environment variables. 

To view the reference configurations that document all environment and YAML variables:

- [Redpanda Console Configuration](/docs/core/console/reference/config) - Main configuration file for Redpanda Console
- [Redpanda Console Role Binding Configuration](/docs/core/console/reference/role-bindings) - Role binding configuration for RBAC
