If you would like to integrate an OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible identity provider that is not yet natively supported in Console,
you can configure the generic OIDC provider. To do so, you first have to create an OAuth application in your identity provider
and then provide this application's credentials in the configuration:

```yaml
login:
  oidc:
    # Whether or not the OIDC provider should be initialized
    enabled: false

    # OAuth application client id
    clientId: ""

    # OAuth application client secret
    clientSecret: ""

    // Domain is the URL without scheme that shall be used as an OIDC endpoint. It will be
    // inserted in this template string: `url.Parse("https://" + cfg.Domain + "/")`.
    domain: ""

    # DisplayName is the name that shall be shown on the login page for this identity provider
    displayName: ""

    # UserIdentifyingClaimKey is a relevant property if you want to use a specific claim key
    # to identify users in the role binding. A claim key is part of the identity provider's
    # issued access token payload.
    # By default, we will use the 'sub' claim key, which usually resolves to the unique ID 
    # within the identity provider. The value of this claim is compared against what you
    # use in the roleBindings for the `name` property.
    userIdentifyingClaimKey: ""
```

## Define role-bindings

When you have setup the OIDC login configuration, you can now bind users to roles. Below you can find a sample
role binding:

```yaml
roleBindings:
  - metadata:
      name: Developers
    subjects:
      - kind: user
        provider: OIDC
        # Name must match the value of your configured claim key
        name: joe@yourcompany.com
    roleName: editor
```
