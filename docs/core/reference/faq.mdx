## Getting started with Redpanda

### Can I use Redpanda for free?
Yes, Redpanda is free and source-available at the [Redpanda GitHub repo](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda).

Additional features are included with the Redpanda Enterprise Edition license. For more information, including a list of the latest enterprise features, see [Redpanda licensing](/docs/core/introduction/licenses). To request a trial license, to extend your trial period, or to purchase an Enterprise Edition license, contact [Redpanda Sales](https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-cloud).

### Is Redpanda fully Kafka API-compatible?

Redpanda works to ensure all Kafka-based applications are compatible with the Redpanda platform. For more information, see [Kafka compatibility](/docs/core/development/kafka-clients).

### Does Redpanda use Zookeeper?

No. Redpanda is a modern streaming platform written in C++, leveraging the Raft protocol for consensus. Because Redpanda uses Raft, there is no need for an external consensus system like Zookeeper.

### Can I run Redpanda directly on Windows or MacOS?

You can only run Redpanda directly on Linux. However, you can use Docker to run Redpanda on any system supported by Docker. See [Quick Start Docker Guide](/docs/core/quickstart/quick-start-docker).

## Consumers and topics

### How do consumer groups and topics interact? 
 * A consumer group allows many topics to be consumed. 
 * A consumer within a group can subscribe to multiple topics. 
 * For each topic that a group subscribes to, the records are sent to one consumer within the group at least once. 
 * Consumer groups are separate. Each group receives each record from each subscribed topic at least once. 

### How are topics and partitions related? 

Topics are split into partitions. 

* Every partition is handled by exactly one leader node in the cluster, so to fully use your cluster, you need at least the same number of partitions as you have nodes. 
* The records within a partition are ordered. 
* There is no ordering between records in different partitions in the same topic.

The partition is the unit of scale. 

* Only one consumer in a group can receive records from a given partition at a specific time. This can change as the group is rebalanced.
* If a consumer cannot keep up, reduce the work per consumer by adding additional consumers. You may also need to increase the number of partitions: because partitions are assigned exclusively to a single consumer, you should have at least three times the number of partitions as consumers to allow for a balanced assignment.
