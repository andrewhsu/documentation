title: I/O optimization
---

Redpanda relies on its own disk I/O scheduler, and by default it tells the kernel to 
use the `noop` scheduler. To provide near-optimal performance,
`rpk` comes with an embedded database of I/O settings for well-known cloud
computers, which are specific combinations of CPUs, SSD types, and VM sizes. 

Running software on four VCPUs isn't the same as running on an EC2 i3.metal
with 96 physical cores. Often, when trying to scale rapidly to meet demands,
product teams don't have time to measure I/O throughput and latency before
starting every new instance (via `rpk iotune`). They need resources immediately. To meet this demand, Redpanda tries to predict the best known
settings for VM cloud types.

Running `rpk iotune` isn't necessary each 
time Redpanda is started. The output properties for `rpk iotune` are written to a file
that can be saved and reused in nodes running on the same type of hardware.

Currently, we only have well-known-types for AWS and GCP. (Azure VM types support
is coming soon.) Upon startup, `rpk` tries to detect the cloud and
instance type from the cloud’s metadata API, setting the correct `iotune`
properties.

If access to the metadata API isn’t allowed from the instance, you can hint
the desired setup by passing the `--well-known-io` flag to `rpk` with the
cloud vendor, VM type, and storage type:

```bash
rpk start --well-known-io 'aws:i3.xlarge:default'
```

It can also be specified in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file, under the `rpk`
object:

```yaml
rpk:
  well_known_io: 'gcp:c2-standard-16:nvme'
```

If `well-known-io` is specified in the config file and also as a flag, then the flag takes precedence.

If a certain cloud vendor, machine type, or storage type isn’t
found, or if the metadata isn’t available and no hint is given, then `rpk` prints a
warning and continues using the default values.
